# Absolutris
A Tetris implementation in pygame. It is called Absolutris because its controls do not rotate or move the pieces relatively, but absolutely. There are four rotation keys, each to rotate a tetromino to face in one of the four directions. Similarly, there are ten movement keys to move the tetromino into one of the ten columns.
